    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll install the popular [XGBoost Library](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and explore how to use this popular boosting model to classify different types of wine using the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository.  In this lesson, we'll install XGBoost on our machines, and then we'll use it make some classifications on the **_Wine Quality Dataset_**!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the general difference between XGBoost and other ensemble algorithms such as AdaBoost\n",
    "* Install and use XGboost\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model is not currently included in scikit-learn, so we'll have to install it on our own.  To install XGBoost, you'll need to use conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install XGBoost, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up a new terminal window.\n",
    "2. Activate your conda environment\n",
    "3. Run `conda install py-xgboost`. You must use conda to install this package--currently, it cannot be installed using `pip`. \n",
    "4. Once installation has completed, run the cell below to verify that everything worked. "
